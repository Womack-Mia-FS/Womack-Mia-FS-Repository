Hello my name is Mia Womack. I am a student from Florida, though I was born in Balitmore, Maryland before moving and living in Virginia for about 6 years. The purpose of this repository is to practice development using version control. This work will help me begin to build a portfolio of skills and accomplishment that can be shared in the future.

## üì¢ &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

‚öôÔ∏è Overview - What I worked on this past week
<br>
üåµ Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
<br>
üèÜ Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
<br>
üîÆ Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

<br>
