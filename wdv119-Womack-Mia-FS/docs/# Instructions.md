This paper addresses some of the topic matter covered in research and activity this week. Be sure to include reference links below to the research and information you used to complete this assignment.

## Topic: Terminal

Professional developers use Terminal daily. It's essential to understand some fundamental commands to use the application.

Update the information below to demonstrate your knowledge on this topic.

**1. Using Terminal, there are essential commands to know.**

List the correct Terminal commands to do the actions listed below. Replace **CMD** with the correct command sequence. You can keep or enhance the brief description.

**The last bullet provides an example**.

- Ctrl + L: Clear the Screen
- pwd: Print the "Working Directory"
- ls -l: List files and folders
- ls -a: List files and folders, including invisible files
- ls -lh: List all files and folders, in human readable form
- cd [folder]: Change directory
- cd /: Change directory, go to root directory
- cd ~: Change directory and go to user home directory
- cd ..: Change directory, go up one folder level
- cd ../../: Change directory, go up two folder levels
- cd ~/Desktop: Change directory to my desktop!

**2. Using Terminal...**

**Folder Drop:** Try typing "cd" followed by a space, and then drag a folder into terminal and press return. Test this out and describe your results below.

## Topic: Version Control & Git

Version control, also known as revision control, records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. In this class, we are learning Git. Update the information below where indicated.

**1. There are three types of version control.**

[ Name & describe the three types of version control here.]

**2. Using Terminal, there are also essential Git commands to know.**

List the correct Git commands to do the actions listed below in Terminal. Replace CMD with the correct command and keep or enhance the brief description.

- git clone: Clone a repository
- git config --global user.name "whatever-name": Set-up a global user name
- git config --global user.email "whatever_email": Set-up a global email address (to match my GitHub account email)
- git status: Shows the current state of your directory and staging area
- git add README.md: Add modified files to the next commit
- git commit --amend: Make a commit with a new message
- git log: Show my commit history
- git <command> -h: Show Git's help screen

**3. Connecting to GitHub using Terminal.**
HTTPS is the the correct way to connect to GitHub in this course. Describe how you connect to GitHub from Terminal using this protocol. What steps do you take?

[ Describe the steps to connect Terminal to a GitHub repo here ]

**4. Using .gitignore and Why it's Important**  
Most repositories contain a .gitignore file.

- What is the purpose of this file?
  <br>
  The purpose of this file is to ensure that certain files not tracked by Git remain untracked.

- What is the "**.DS_Store**" file and why would you want to ignore it?
  <br>
  It's a hidden file created by macOS Finder. It's all well and good for Mac, but if you're transferring files to a non-Mac, where it's unnecessary, then it can clutter up files and stuff. Overall, it's just a huge mess for non-Macs, so it's best to ignore it.

- What other file or folder would you want to add to a .gitignore file and why?

There's always gonna be someone out there that can provide you answers to your questions, especially for a software because if one video doesn't work if you don't have a specific version, then you can find another video with the right version.)
