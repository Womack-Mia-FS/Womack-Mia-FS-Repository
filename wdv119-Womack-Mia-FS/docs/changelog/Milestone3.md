> There are a lot of changes made to this project, especially since I had to add the secondary pages.
> I added the redirect links to the top of the homepage.
> I was trying to get the links (About Us, Destinations, Tours, Blogs) in a neat row and centered row -- but no such luck getting it centered.
> I finally managed to make my header background image bigger! There are so many methods to do this (I was scrolling for awhile) until I even found the right one. And what do you know? It worked!
> I added more <br>s due to the enlarged header to make sure they weren't being overshadowed by it.
> One important thing that I did was read the comments on the Figma thing to see how I was going to decorate my site. One thiing I noticed was the frequent comment on consistently use similar themes.
> With this, I first worked on the Tours Page, I believe. Mostly because that page just has colored tags for the headers.
> It was a bit difficult to make the colored tags, but I managed it. I also managed to get them to line up the way that it was in the Figma/Sketch Pages. 
> Another note was to add images, but I needed to figure out how to do that with making it too busy. To accomplish this, I downloaded an image and tried to see what I can do with it.
> I've decided to frame the picture as well as shape it (I've chose a circle). I googled how to make shapes and frames and found a great website with working methods.
> After finding that website, I learned and used all of the shapes that I could.
> After finishing with this page, I started working with the Destinations Page because one of the shapes I've learned was stars, and this page was designed for stars.
> I design the page the way it was on Figma and add the stars to it. I wasn't able to position them behind the text like they were supposed to, but it was close enough.
> On of the biggest things that I struggled with was the fonts. I have to relearn how to do them because I have not been able to use any downloaded ones (because the default ones are ugly).
> When I say I struggled with images, I mean I STRUGGLED. I started working on the Blog page, and I was try to put the text over the corner image -- like it is in the Sketch, but I couldn't figure out how. So, it's just sitting right by its would-be border.
> Speaking of page borders -- I added sooooo many! In my opinion, borders are perfect to adding character without making things extremely busy.
> I don't know what to do with the font to make my words more appealing. I don't want to just keep adding images because that would be too much, and I feel like making the texts more appealing would be a better choice.
