> Here, I made some major revisions to the layout and appearance via HTML. This is because I didn't do a very good job the first time, so I had to revisit to remember certain things such as flex-items.
> I added a label to the search bar to make it more functional and better looking.
> I added some color to the buttons and changed the size to look more like the ones in the png.
> I added in the strong elements via the span style in order to color the words "Perfect Trip" in line 47.
> I used flex-container/item for the items with the book now options, but I'm still trying to get the text over the photos and the button under them
> After many trials and errors, I finally got the tour images in a row!
> Looked at the comment from last week and did <figure> with the images in order to add captions and stuff
> I have been looking for solutions on making the header bigger and found one, but it's not as big as I wanted it to be.
> I worked more on the buttons, more specifically the search button for the search bar, and put them where they needed to be. 
> I added a color for the background but didn't want it to stray from the mock-up, so I stuck with a shade of white -- just used white smoke.
