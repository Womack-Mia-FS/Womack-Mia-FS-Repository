This repository will be used to keep track of research and development conducted in this class. Follow the instructions below to get started.

### Getting Started

**1.** Review the [About](./docs/01_about/README.md) README and all of the links it provides.

**2.** Review the documentation and [Getting Started](./docs/02_getting_started/README.md) steps in this repository's docs folder.

**3.** Attend the first Live Lecture to see a live setup demo. If you are unable to attend, make sure to watch the archive.

### Next Steps...

After completing the above steps, feel free to begin updating this readme where indicated below. Remember to update this document each week to receive proper credit for the weekly Milestone assignment.

Hello my name is Mia Womack. I am a student from Florida, though I was born in Balitmore, Maryland before moving and living in Virginia for about 6 years. The purpose of this repository is to practice development using version control. This work will help me begin to build a portfolio of skills and accomplishment that can be shared in the future.

## üì¢ &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

‚öôÔ∏è Overview - What I worked on this past week
<br>
üåµ Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
<br>
üèÜ Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
<br>
üîÆ Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

<br>

### Week 1

I worked on setting up all of my folders, looked over the assignments for this week, tried to do the mental math (ugh) to figure out how much time needs to be divided between assignments and a rough estimate on how each might take, and I also worked on some personal projects such as doing a little writing (I have a crap ton of book outlines set-up, some with more information than others, and the one I'm currently working on is one of the horror short stories) and worked a bit on my story for my ghostwriting job. Some of the issues I had was, I guess, deciding what to use (Terminal, GitHub Desktop) because on one hand, doing Terminal would've helped level up my coding and the set-up, but on the other hand, I mostly took the class just for the basics of web development because I'm planning on using Wix since I love the templates and how easy it is to work with. I temporarily resolved this issue by deciding to use GitHub Desktop for now and consider Terminal later when I have a much better grasp on coding. It's hard to say what I "leveled up" on since it feels a bit too early, but I think I can cite being able to make portfolios - an important skill considering I do freelance work. My next step is to focus more on coding in general - especially with javascript. I still struggle with any script coding, and that's one of the most important features that I would have for almost of my work.

### Week 2

I was working on the changelog and everything for the website. I had to do this because the website didn't look like the mock-up. I'm still struggling with setting up the footer properly, enlarging the header image properly, center aligning the images, etc. etc. As I was working in Figma, I gotta admit, I like Canva better lol Maybe because I'm more used to it, there are more designs and stuff, and I just like it more. Figma seems like ti would have better functions like the navigational buttons and whatnot, but I defintely prefer Canva. That being said; I still loved messing around with Figma to see what I can do! I think I leveled up with websites as a whole, especially when I had to start making changes on the html file. I've always struggled with button functions and nav and stuff, so I think the increas in exposure has helped with that. I think the challenges I've faced would definitely be the grid and stuff. I really have a problem with those especially if I'm using the inline CSS for the HTML page. I don't know if it's just me, but the CSS page feels like it's easier than HTML when it comes to styling.

### Week 3

Stay tuned, this stand up is coming soon...

### Week 4

My final stand up...
